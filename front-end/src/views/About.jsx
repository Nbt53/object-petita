                    Simge Vurtak is a UK-based ceramics artist,
                     expressing her thoughts and emotions through
                      the medium of clay.

                    <p className="about-text mb-small">
                    Her style is characterised by its dark yet humorous and grotesque elements, serving as a reflection of her playful approach to exploring the human psyche. Rather than stemming from melancholia, her work is a deliberate exercise of pondering and action,
                     inviting viewers to engage with their own thoughts and feelings. 
                    </p>
                    <p className="about-text">
                    Simge believes in the archaic playfulness of humanity, often referencing to the concept of 
                    &apos;Homo-Ludens&apos;—Men, The Player—in her toy/object like creations. 
                    </p>
                    <p className="about-text">
                    Drawing inspiration from her latest readings on Lacan, her work integrates elements of this
                     theory that focuses on human desire and its mechanics.
